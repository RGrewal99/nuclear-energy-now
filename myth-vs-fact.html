            <p>There are many misconceptions and disinformation in the discourse about nuclear power. On Myth vs Fact, we're going to set the record straight about nuclear energy. From concerns about safety to misunderstandings about waste disposal, nuclear power has been overshadowed by myths that don't align with reality. By breaking down the facts with clear evidence, we aim to highlight the reliability, sustainability, and benefits of nuclear energy as a key component of our global energy future.</p>

                        <h2>Myth: Nuclear energy is unsafe.</h2>
                        <p><em>Fact:</em> Nuclear energy is one of the safest forms of energy production. Modern reactors are designed with multiple layers of safety systems to prevent accidents, ensuring that nuclear power remains a highly reliable energy source. These systems include passive cooling mechanisms, containment structures, and automated shutdown procedures that drastically minimize the risk of failures. Additionally, stringent regulatory oversight and continuous advancements in reactor technology further enhance safety. Compared to other energy sources, nuclear has one of the lowest accident rates per unit of electricity generated, making it a key component of a secure and sustainable energy future.</p>

                        <p><em>Fact:</em> Nuclear waste is managed through strict regulations and advanced technologies, ensuring its safe storage and disposal. Governments and nuclear organisations enforce rigorous safety standards to minimise any risk to the public or the environment. Modern waste management techniques include secure containment, deep geological repositories, and recycling processes that allow for reusing valuable materials while reducing waste volume. Continuous research and innovation further enhance safety measures, making nuclear waste management a highly controlled and reliable process that ensures long-term sustainability.</p>

                        <h2>Myth: Radiation from nuclear plants is harmful to people nearby.
                        </h2>
                        <p><em>Fact:</em> Nuclear power plants emit very low levels of radiation, far below natural background radiation and well within strict safety standards set by regulatory agencies like the IAEA. Everyday sources—such as cosmic rays, radon gas, and even certain foods—expose people to significantly more radiation than a properly functioning nuclear plant. Advanced reactor designs utilize shielding, containment structures, and continuous monitoring to minimize radiation exposure, ensuring nuclear energy remains one of the safest and cleanest power sources. In contrast, coal power plants actually emit more radiation into the atmosphere because coal contains trace amounts of radioactive elements like uranium and thorium, which are released when burned. This makes nuclear energy not only a low-carbon alternative but also a lower-radiation option compared to fossil fuels.</p>

                        <h2>Myth: Nuclear power plants can explode like nuclear bombs.
                        </h2>
                        <p><em>Fact:</em> Nuclear reactors operate completely differently from nuclear weapons and cannot explode like bombs. Nuclear bombs rely on a rapid, uncontrolled chain reaction, while reactors use moderators and control rods to regulate fission safely. They also use low-enriched uranium, making a nuclear explosion physically impossible. Built-in fail-safe mechanisms ensure stability, preventing dangerous scenarios and prioritizing controlled energy production over anything resembling a detonation.</p>

                        <h2>Myth: Nuclear power isn't needed because renewables can fully replace fossil fuels.
                        </h2>
                        <p><em>Fact:</em> While renewable energy sources like solar and wind are valuable for reducing emissions, they are inherently intermittent, meaning their power generation fluctuates based on weather and time of day. This unpredictability creates challenges for maintaining a stable and continuous electricity supply. In contrast, nuclear energy provides a steady, reliable base-load power source, operating 24/7 regardless of external conditions. Nuclear reactors produce consistent electricity without reliance on sun, wind, or battery storage, ensuring grid stability and energy security. By complementing renewables, nuclear power helps balance energy fluctuations, supporting a resilient and dependable electricity system.
